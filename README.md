# Milestone5
## Running Instructions
* Using Interllij IDEA
* Open build.gradle
* The path for the code I worte: src/main/java/org/json/XML.java, from line 866 to line 939
* The test file path: src/test/java/org/json/junit/YuchenHuTest.java

### Documentation for my work
* Instead of returning a JSONObject, the new method returns a Future with JSONObject. 
* I wrote a runner to run the asyncronized methods. Please add the future tasks using the "add" method, and then use the "run" method to run the runner.

### Thank you very much!
